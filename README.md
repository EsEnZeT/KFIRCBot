Properly installed mutator should show in the server console something like this:
```

## Usage
[`KFIRCBot`] is a fully automated mutator but you can also use following commands on channel:
* `!status` - force show current game status
* `!s <message>` - send message through bot to active game
* `!log <1/0>` - ON/OFF logging active gameplay events to channel.
* `!help` - will show all of the above commands, just in case if you forget

Even if `fLog` will be defined as 0 you can still get output from any commands posted above.
Only `!s <message>` won't care about `fLog` parameter (will send message to players and forcibly enable logging), because you want to get answers right?

For example, if you used `fLog=0` bot will join channel and won't log current gameplay as long as you don't tell him to do this: `!log 1`.
It can be usefull if you don't want too much spam, but if you want to use it without that, just specify `fLog=1` in config.
